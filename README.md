- 👋 Hi, I’m Tania
  
-## 🚀 About Me
- 🔭 I’m currently working on building a Python tool for a CMOS detector system in astronomical instrumentation. Core features of the tool consist of reading, processing, and analysing raw CMOS detector data from astronomical observations, simulating CMOS detector performance for a given astronomical setup, and evaluating and comparing CMOS sensor performance across different models for astronomical use.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: machine learning applications in astronomy, and convex optimisation for enhancing system performance.
              
- 🔭 I’ve been working on modelling the technical specifications of fibre positioning system for astronomical instrumentation.
- 🔭 My work on the dust obscuration of SF galaxies is published. **Journal DOI:** [10.1017/pasa.2024.2](https://doi.org/10.1017/pasa.2024.2)). My follow up work on understanding the link between dust obscuration and star formation rate in galaxies is currently under review.
- 🎤 I occasionally give talks and presentations, most recently on stellar companions, which is an exciting collaborative project.

## 🌟 Fun Facts
- 🥂 I once received red wine as a gift for a colloquium I gave!
- 🎉 I'm known for making great plans, even if they involve a bit of spilled wine (it happens to the best of us!).
