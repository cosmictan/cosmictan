- 👋 Hi, I’m Tania
  
-## 🚀 About Me
- 🔭 I’m currently working on understanding the link between dust obscuration and star formation rate in galaxies, and also on a fibre positioning system for astronomical instrumentation.
- 🎤 I occasionally give talks and presentations, most recently on stellar companions, which is an exciting collaborative project.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: machine learning applications in astronomy, convex optimization.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Matlab
- **Tools**: NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, plotly, seaborn, SciPy, etc.
- **Technologies**: Wideband antenna array, Metamaterial, Active and passive devices, Fibre positioning system, Brain imaging system, Telescope detector system

## 🖥️ Projects & Research
- **[Project 1]**: Radio detected galaxies and their obscured properties
- **[Project 2]**: Exploring the relationship between dust geometry and star formation rate
- **[Project 3]**: Enhancing astronomical exploration with the GMT/MANIFEST (MANIFEST Science)
- **[Project 4]**: Modelling the technical specifications for future multi-object spectroscopy instrumentation
- **[Project 5]**: A comparison of the rotation periods of single and binary planet-hosting and non-planet hosting stars
- **[Project 6]**: Gain and noise estimation of the detector system and understanding the performance of cryogenic pre-amplifier
- **[Project 7]**: Wideband microwave medical diagnostic and therapeutic systems (brain tumor detection system)

## 🌟 Fun Facts
- 🥂 I once received red wine as a gift for a colloquium I gave!
- 🎉 I'm known for making great plans, even if they involve a bit of spilled wine (it happens to the best of us!).
