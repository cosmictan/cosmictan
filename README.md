- 👋 Hi, I’m @cosmictan
  
-## 🚀 About Me
- 🔭 I’m currently working on understanding the link between dust obscuration and star formation rate in galaxies, and also on a fiber positioning system for astronomical instrumentation.
- 🎤 I occasionally give talks and presentations, most recently on stellar companions, which is an exciting collaborative project outside my PhD.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: machine learning applications in astronomy, convex optimization, etc.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Matlab
- **Tools**: NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, etc.
- **Technologies**:Fiber positioning system, Brain imaging system, telescope detector technology.

## 🖥️ Projects & Research
- **[Paper 1]**: Radio detected galaxies and their obscured properties
- **[Paper 2]**: Exploring the relationship between dust geometry and star formation rate
- **[Paper 3]**: Modelling the technical specifications for future multi-object spectroscopy instrumentation
- **[Paper 4]**: A Comparison of the Rotation Periods of Single and Binary Planet-Hosting and Non-Planet Hosting Stars

## 🌟 Fun Facts
- 🥂 I once received red wine as a gift for a colloquium I gave!
- 🎉 I'm known for making great plans, even if they involve a bit of spilled wine (it happens to the best of us!).
